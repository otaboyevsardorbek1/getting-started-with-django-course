A course from [Talk Python Training](https://training.talkpython.fm/). Sign up at [Getting Started with Django](https://training.talkpython.fm/courses/getting-started-with-django).

## Course Summary

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is one of the most popular web frameworks for coding in Python. It includes libraries for: templating HTML content, URL routing, views, a robust Object Relational Model (ORM) for mapping classes to database queries, HTML form management, a built-in administrative tool, and much more. This course teaches you how to build your first Django project and guides you through the key parts of the library.

This course is constructed around a project called **Alexandria**, a virtual library.  Each chapter covers a new Django concept, but it also adds a feature to the application. As you proceed through the course you will not only learn more about Django but also be building features and tests as you would for developing real world software.
